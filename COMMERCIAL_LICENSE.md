GiaNode is a dual-licensed project:

- âœ… **Open Use**: Available under the [MIT License](LICENSE) for personal, educational, and non-commercial projects.  
- ðŸ’¼ **Commercial Use**: Requires a separate commercial license.

## What Is Considered Commercial Use?

You must obtain a commercial license if you:

- Sell or bundle GiaNode (code or hardware) in a paid product or kit
- Use GiaNode in a paid SaaS, mobile app, or subscription platform
- Integrate GiaNode into a commercial greenhouse or enterprise system
- Offer GiaNode as a consulting service or hosted solution

## Whatâ€™s Included in the Commercial License?

- Legal permission to use GiaNode in commercial products
- Access to extended support or enterprise tools (optional)
- Ethical use agreement that aligns with the projectâ€™s mission

## Why This Model?

GiaNode was created to support growers, makers, and communities â€” not to be extracted by companies without recognition or reinvestment.

This model protects the open-source mission while allowing responsible companies to benefit and collaborate.
